<!-- WorkAround Explorer
This is a premade project from codecademy.

This is the project prompt:
WorkAround is a research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry. 
Open up salaryData.js to see the data they have collected. 
Youâ€™ll notice that they have also created a few functions for 
filtering that data to get subsets of data by role and by company.

WorkAround now wants to release a new web application called 
WorkAround Explorer to make their data more easily viewable.
This web app should allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to see the following information:

The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
The industry average for the chosen role.
The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.

Much of the user interface has already been designed by front-end developers, however,
the core data and functionality are either missing or need to be connected together using modules.
Your task is to help your team members out by using your import and export expertise!

The following steps were taken to enhance my knowledge of js modules:
4.As mentioned before, even if you correctly completed the previous two tasks, 
  the radio-style <input> elements still will not render and some of the columns have disappeared. 
  This is because we are now required to specify that main.js is using modules.

  In index.html, add a type attribute to <script src='main.js'> with the correct value to indicate 
  that the main.js script is using modules.

  After completing this task, all three columns should render again and you should see the radio-style 
  <input> elements rendered in your application!
