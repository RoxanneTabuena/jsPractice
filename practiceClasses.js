/*School Catalogue
Letâ€™s put your knowledge of classes to the test by creating a digital school 
catalog for the New York City Department of Education. 
The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold 
quick reference material for each school in the city.

We need to create classes for primary and high schools. 
Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent School class. 
Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:  */

  class School {
    constructor(name, level, numberOfStudents) {
      this._name = name;
      this._level = level;
